* Introduction

There's something magical about the simplicity of a perfectly cooked pasta dish. Today, I'm sharing my go-to recipe for /Aglio e Olio/ - a classic Italian pasta that proves you don't need many ingredients to create something extraordinary.

* Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- Sea salt and black pepper

* The Cooking Process

** Preparing the Base

The secret to great /Aglio e Olio/ lies in the gentle cooking of garlic in olive oil. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-low heat, then add the sliced garlic. The goal is golden, fragrant garlic - never brown or burnt.

** Bringing It Together

Once your spaghetti is al dente, reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water before draining. This liquid gold will help create a silky sauce that clings to every strand.

Add the hot pasta directly to the garlic oil, along with a splash of pasta water. Toss vigorously - this is where the magic happens as the starch emulsifies with the oil.

* The Final Touch

Finish with fresh parsley, a generous grating of cheese, and a crack of black pepper. The dish should be glossy, aromatic, and utterly irresistible.

* Reflection

Cooking this dish reminds me why I love simple Italian cuisine. With just a handful of quality ingredients and proper technique, you can create something that feeds both the body and soul. The key is respecting each component and understanding how they work together.

** Tips for Success

- Use the best olive oil you can afford
- Don't rush the garlic - low and slow is the way
- Save that pasta water - it's crucial for the sauce
- Serve immediately while everything is hot

/Buon appetito!/
